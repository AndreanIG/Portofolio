I joined <strong>Camp Paws</strong> in Melbourne because I have always loved animals. I missed my pets back home and wanted to do something that let me reconnect with that sense of care and companionship. Working as a pet sitter was also a way for me to improve my communication skills and learn to handle responsibility in unfamiliar environments.
</section>

<hr />

<h3 id="-starting-out">🐾 Starting Out</h3>

<p>Camp Paws did not have a physical office. Everything was managed through <strong>WhatsApp</strong> and a specialized application. I applied for several assignments when I first joined, but many were rejected. Some clients preferred sitters with more experience or longer availability. At first, it was disappointing, but I learned to approach each rejection as a chance to improve. I refined how I introduced myself, how I communicated reliability, and how I described my previous experience with animals.</p>

<p>Eventually, I began to receive more trust from clients. The first few visits were careful and quiet. I entered other people’s homes, followed instructions precisely, and took time to understand each dog’s habits. I learned to be patient and consistent, especially with animals that took time to warm up to new people.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-the-dogs-i-remember-most">🐶 The Dogs I Remember Most</h3>

<p>Among the many dogs I cared for, three stand out in my memory: <strong>Ivy</strong>, <strong>Ziggy</strong>, and <strong>Kreuzer</strong>.<br />
Ivy was gentle and alert, always watching before coming close. Ziggy liked to follow routines and noticed every small change. Kreuzer was strong and playful, but needed calm handling when walking outdoors. They each taught me something different about care and observation.</p>

<p>Through them, I learned that trust is not something that can be rushed. It is built through quiet repetition, small gestures, and consistent presence. These lessons stayed with me long after each visit ended.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-lessons-learned">✨ Lessons Learned</h3>

<p>Working as a pet sitter was not only about caring for animals. It was about developing patience and empathy in practical ways. I learned that communication is more than what is spoken. Dogs respond to tone, energy, and rhythm. The way I moved or reacted could change how they behaved. This awareness also improved how I interacted with clients, helping me communicate clearly and respectfully.</p>

<p>The rejections I faced at the beginning reminded me to be humble and persistent. Over time, I learned that responsibility grows not just from experience but from reliability and genuine care.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-reflection">💭 Reflection</h3>

<p>This experience reminded me of my own pets, the routines I used to have with them, and how much those small moments meant to me. Being around Ivy, Ziggy, and Kreuzer gave me a sense of home in a different city. It also helped me appreciate the simple value of care such as showing up on time, keeping promises, and being patient when things do not go as planned.</p>

<p>Every visit taught me something about trust and consistency, both in animals and in people. It was quiet work, but it left a lasting impression on how I understand empathy and communication.</p>

The paper, <strong>CSER: Context-Sensitive Emotion Recognition Framework using Visual and Textual Features</strong>, introduces a multimodal system that integrates <strong>Vision Transformers (ViT)</strong> and <strong>Vision-Language Models (VLMs)</strong> — specifically LLaVA and BLIP — to improve emotion recognition in complex, real-world settings.<br />
It was written in collaboration with <strong>Dr. Thuseethan Selvarajah</strong>, <strong>Prof. Sutharshan Rajasegarar</strong>, and <strong>Prof. John Yearwood</strong> from Deakin University, and submitted to <em>IEEE Transactions on Multimedia</em>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-motivation">💡 Motivation</h3>

<p>Most emotion recognition models focus on a single modality such as facial expressions or voice.<br />
In contrast, human emotion is shaped by context — the surrounding scene, body posture, and situation.<br />
The goal of CSER was to make emotion recognition <strong>context-aware</strong>, bridging the gap between how AI systems interpret emotions and how humans perceive them.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="️-technical-summary">⚙️ Technical Summary</h3>

<p>CSER combines three ViT-based visual learners for the <strong>face</strong>, <strong>body</strong>, and <strong>scene</strong> with textual embeddings generated by <strong>LLaVA</strong> and <strong>BLIP</strong>.<br />
All modalities are projected into a shared latent space and fused using <strong>multi-head</strong> and <strong>self-attention</strong> mechanisms.</p>

<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Achieved <strong>mAP = 40.49%</strong> on EMOTIC</li>
  <li>Achieved <strong>mAP = 54.28%</strong> on HECO</li>
  <li>Outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods on both datasets</li>
  <li>Showed major gains in subtle emotions such as <em>sadness</em>, <em>fear</em>, and <em>embarrassment</em></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="-the-hard-part">🧠 The Hard Part</h3>

<p>This project required months of experimentation, dataset preparation, and repeated failures.</p>

<p><strong>Dataset scarcity:</strong><br />
Finding <strong>group or context-sensitive emotion datasets</strong> was nearly impossible. EMOTIC and HECO were the only usable ones, but both had fragmented labels and inconsistent annotations that needed manual remapping.</p>

<p><strong>Data quality issues:</strong><br />
Many images contained occluded faces, low light, or incomplete subjects.<br />
To maintain uniform input shapes, I had to implement fallback logic that replaced missing faces with zero matrices — a tedious but necessary step to keep the training pipeline stable.</p>

<p><strong>Hardware constraints:</strong><br />
All experiments initially ran on a <strong>GTX 1660 Ti</strong>, forcing constant trade-offs between batch size, learning rate, and runtime stability.<br />
Training large vision-language models pushed the limits of available memory, often causing crashes mid-run.<br />
To overcome this, I used <strong>external GPU resources provided by Deakin University’s research infrastructure and Hugging Face’s compute credits</strong>.<br />
Setting up the remote GPU environments took significant effort — configuring CUDA, aligning PyTorch versions, and establishing secure connections — but it was essential to complete the experiments at full scale.</p>

<p><strong>VLM integration:</strong><br />
LLaVA and BLIP produced embeddings with incompatible dimensions and token structures.<br />
Aligning and projecting them into a shared feature space was one of the most complex implementation challenges.</p>

<p><strong>Paper formatting:</strong><br />
Preparing the IEEE manuscript involved condensing large figures, tuning Grad-CAM++ visualizations, and formatting 17 pages of results under strict LaTeX templates.</p>

<p>Every part — from data cleaning to writing — tested both patience and problem-solving endurance.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-reflection">💭 Reflection</h3>

<p>Despite the obstacles, completing CSER taught me what true research persistence feels like.<br />
It was a lesson in problem-solving under constraint — working with incomplete datasets, limited hardware, and long iteration cycles — yet still producing a model that achieved measurable progress.</p>

<p>Being the youngest member in the author list, I handled most of the experimental setup, ablation design, and manuscript drafting.<br />
This experience taught me to think beyond implementation — to question design decisions, justify model behavior, and communicate results in a research-standard way.</p>

<p>It reminded me that scientific progress is not just about accuracy; it’s about the discipline to keep iterating when nothing seems to work.</p>

The objective was to experiment with the <strong>KinectFusion</strong> algorithm for real-time 3D reconstruction using RGB-D data from the <strong>TUM dataset</strong>.<br />
The task focused on executing a published implementation, measuring reconstruction accuracy, and analyzing limitations under different environmental complexities.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-objective">🎯 Objective</h3>

<p>The goal was to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Implement and execute the KinectFusion algorithm on local hardware.</li>
  <li>Reconstruct 3D scenes from multiple TUM RGB-D sequences.</li>
  <li>Record performance metrics — processing time, FPS, and RMSE.</li>
  <li>Analyze how scene complexity affects reconstruction accuracy.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="️-implementation">⚙️ Implementation</h3>

<p>The Python-based KinectFusion repository was used from<br />
<a href="https://github.com/JingwenWang95/KinectFusion">https://github.com/JingwenWang95/KinectFusion</a></p>

<p>All dependencies were installed in an isolated environment to prevent package conflicts.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel® Core™ i7-10750H (2.60 GHz)</li>
  <li><strong>GPU:</strong> NVIDIA® GeForce GTX 1660 Ti</li>
  <li><strong>Memory:</strong> 32 GB RAM</li>
</ul>

<p>This configuration was capable of handling dense depth fusion but did not reach real-time frame rates.<br />
Each sequence required several minutes of processing depending on scene complexity and voxel resolution.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-experimental-results">📈 Experimental Results</h3>

<h4 id="dataset-fr1_rpy">Dataset: FR1_RPY</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Average processing time:</strong> 0.132 s / frame</li>
  <li><strong>Frame rate:</strong> 7.55 FPS</li>
  <li><strong>RMSE:</strong> 0.064 m</li>
  <li><strong>Observation:</strong> Reconstruction accuracy was high; only minor missing polygons in localized regions.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="dataset-fr1_room">Dataset: FR1_Room</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Average processing time:</strong> 0.158 s / frame</li>
  <li><strong>Frame rate:</strong> 6.35 FPS</li>
  <li><strong>RMSE:</strong> 0.267 m</li>
  <li><strong>Observation:</strong> Reconstruction degraded in complex indoor environments; polygon loss and surface noise were visible.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="-analysis">🧠 Analysis</h3>

<p>Scene complexity had a measurable impact on performance.<br />
Simpler geometries (FR1_RPY) produced stable meshes with low RMSE, whereas cluttered indoor scenes (FR1_Room) reduced both accuracy and speed.<br />
Even with discrete GPU acceleration, real-time operation was not achieved.<br />
The bottleneck occurred during <strong>voxel integration</strong> and <strong>surface fusion</strong>, confirming the trade-off between reconstruction precision and computational speed in volumetric mapping.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-reflection">🧭 Reflection</h3>

<p>This task provided hands-on understanding of dense SLAM and the computational limits of real-time 3D vision.<br />
Reconstructing multiple datasets reinforced concepts in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>RGB-D frame alignment and TSDF fusion</li>
  <li>Hardware–software performance trade-offs</li>
  <li>Evaluation metrics (FPS / RMSE)</li>
  <li>Visual inspection of mesh completeness</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>BHFMS (Boarding House Finder &amp; Management System)</strong> is a full-featured web application created as my Bachelor’s thesis at <strong>Bina Nusantara University</strong>, developed together with <strong>Aditya Winata</strong> and <strong>Gardion Philipus Saltana</strong>, and supervised by <strong>Pualam Dipa Nusantara, S.Kom., M.Kom.</strong><br />
The system serves both as a modern marketplace for Indonesian boarding houses (kos-kosan) and as an operational dashboard for owners, tenants, and admins.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="background--problem">Background &amp; Problem</h3>

<p>Jakarta’s growing urbanization and the high cost of housing make boarding houses essential for students and workers. Existing platforms only focus on listing properties, but still lack features for operations (payment management, complaints, inventory), verified information, and seamless communication between tenants and landlords.</p>

<p>BHFMS fills this gap by unifying search, management, and communications in a single VILT-stack web platform.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h3>

<p>BHFMS enables:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Centralized discovery:</strong> Search and filter kos-kosan by location, price, facilities, and more.</li>
  <li><strong>Verified operations:</strong> Owners and managers can manage tenants, payments, complaints, and property inventories.</li>
  <li><strong>Effortless communication:</strong> Tenants chat directly with owners/managers, upload payment proofs, and raise complaints; admins ensure trust and moderation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Role-based access ensures each user group (tenant, owner/manager, admin) has the right tools for their needs.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="features-by-role">Features by Role</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Tenant:</strong> Search, distance filter, rich listings, wishlist, reviews, chat, complaints, upload payment proofs.</li>
  <li><strong>Owner/Manager:</strong> Dashboards for properties, tenants, payments, inventory, complaints, and chat.</li>
  <li><strong>Admin:</strong> Listing verification, transaction oversight, moderation, pre-publish approvals.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="tech-stack">Tech Stack</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Vue.js</strong> + <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> (frontend)</li>
  <li><strong>Inertia.js</strong> (SPA routing)</li>
  <li><strong>Laravel</strong> (backend)</li>
  <li><strong>Pusher/Laravel Echo</strong> (real-time messaging)</li>
  <li><strong>SQL</strong> (structured roles, payments, chats, reviews, complaints)</li>
  <li><strong>AWS Lightsail + NGINX Unit</strong> (deployment)</li>
  <li><strong>Advanced search/ranking with Haversine</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Robust, fair review ranking with Bayesian average</strong></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="smart-search-haversine-formula">Smart Search: Haversine Formula</h3>

<p>BHFMS uses the Haversine formula for accurate, location-based search—ranking boarding houses by true real-world distance (great-circle) to the user’s target location.</p>

<h3 id="bayesian-rating-fair-property-rankings">Bayesian Rating: Fair Property Rankings</h3>

<p>To avoid ranking properties unfairly (for example, where a single 5-star review boosts a new listing to the top), BHFMS uses a <strong>Bayesian average</strong> for property ratings.</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Average rating for the property: <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">R</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.00773em;">R</span></span></span></span></li>

As reviews grow, the score reflects the property’s real reputation <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">R</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.00773em;">R</span></span></span></span>.<br />
Prevents new or manipulated listings from unfairly topping search results.</p>
