When I started working as a <strong>Pet Sitter at Camp Paws</strong> in Melbourne, I thought it would be simple. Feed them, walk them, keep them company. But it turned out to be so much more. Each animal had its own personality, routine, and little quirks that made every day feel different from the one before.
</section>

<hr />

<h3 id="-getting-to-know-the-pack">🐾 Getting to Know the Pack</h3>

<p>The first few days were a blur of wagging tails, curious eyes, and a lot of barking. Some dogs were shy, others greeted me like an old friend. Cats, of course, acted like they owned the place. It took time for them to trust me. I learned to speak their language, not through words, but through patience, rhythm, and consistency.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/career-petsitter-dogwindow.jpg" alt="Golden retriever looking out a window" class="img-fluid rounded shadow" /></p>

<p>One dog named Milo always refused to eat unless I sat next to him. Another, Daisy, only calmed down when I hummed softly during walks. Every pet had a story, and I slowly became part of those stories, one walk and one meal at a time.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-mornings-at-camp-paws">🌞 Mornings at Camp Paws</h3>

<p>Mornings began early. The city was quiet, and the air carried the smell of wet grass and coffee from the nearby café. I would start by feeding the dogs, checking their water bowls, and making sure each one got a bit of attention before their walks. There was a peaceful rhythm to it — the kind that makes you forget about time for a while.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/career-petsitter-walk.jpg" alt="Dog on morning walk in park" class="img-fluid rounded shadow" /></p>

<p>Walking through the park with four dogs at once was always an adventure. Some wanted to chase birds, others wanted to roll in the grass. It was both chaos and calm at the same time, and I learned how to find balance in the middle of it.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-little-lessons-from-quiet-companions">🐶 Little Lessons from Quiet Companions</h3>

<p>What surprised me most was how much the animals taught me. They reminded me that care is not about control but about understanding. You cannot rush trust; you have to earn it with consistency and calm energy. The more time I spent with them, the more I realized that the same principles apply to people.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/career-petsitter-blanket.jpg" alt="Dog resting on blanket at home" class="img-fluid rounded shadow" /></p>

<p>Some days were exhausting, especially when owners called last minute or a pet got sick. But seeing the joy in their eyes when they recognized me made it all worth it. There is something grounding about being trusted by a creature that speaks no words yet understands everything through your tone and patience.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="️-saying-goodbye">❤️ Saying Goodbye</h3>

<p>The hardest part was always the goodbyes. Pets would rush to the door, tails wagging, as their owners returned from trips. The house would suddenly feel a little quieter. It was bittersweet — a small reminder that I had done my job well.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/career-petsitter-goodbye.jpg" alt="Owner hugging their dog at pickup" class="img-fluid rounded shadow" /></p>

<p>Each visit was a small connection, a reminder of how simple and pure trust can be when it is built with care. I left every home with a little fur on my clothes and a full heart.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-what-i-learned">💭 What I Learned</h3>

<p>Being a pet sitter taught me the quiet power of empathy. Animals notice your energy more than your words. They teach you to slow down, to listen, and to stay present. Caring for them is not only about responsibility but also about respect.</p>

<p>It reminded me that kindness is not something grand. Sometimes, it looks like filling a bowl of water, going for one more walk in the rain, or sitting beside a restless dog until it falls asleep.</p>

In May 2024, I earned the Microsoft Certified Azure AI Engineer Associate credential.  
The program deepened my understanding of how to design, implement, and manage AI applications that run in production environments on Azure.  
It connected theoretical knowledge of machine learning with real implementation practices using cloud infrastructure.
</section>

<hr />

<h3 id="-what-i-learned">💡 What I Learned</h3>

<p>The course introduced me to Azure Cognitive Services, the Machine Learning Studio, and the orchestration of data pipelines for scalable AI models.<br />
Through practical projects, I learned how to integrate services for vision, speech, and language understanding into complete end-to-end solutions.<br />
It also taught me how to optimize performance, secure data, and ensure ethical and responsible use of AI.</p>

<p>More than the technical material, this certification improved how I think about deploying AI at scale.<br />
I began to see the importance of reliability, monitoring, and transparency when designing systems that directly impact users and organizations.</p>

Working as a <strong>Data Scientist at Telkom Indonesia</strong> was both exciting and humbling. It was my first time applying machine learning in a large company environment, surrounded by people whose curiosity matched their technical skill. Every day brought a mix of learning, experimentation, and teamwork that reminded me why I fell in love with data in the first place.
</section>

<hr />

<h3 id="-first-impressions">🧠 First Impressions</h3>

<p>The first few weeks were filled with exploration. I spent hours reading documentation, studying internal systems, and understanding how different teams approached data problems. I had worked with models before, but this was different. Here, my code was part of something larger — a system that affected real employees, real processes, and real decisions.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/career-datascientist-office.jpg" alt="Office workspace with data screens" class="img-fluid rounded shadow" /></p>

<p>My first major project focused on facial recognition for employee management. The idea was simple: create a system that could identify staff members efficiently, helping automate attendance and improve security. Simple ideas, however, rarely stay simple. There were countless details to consider — image quality, lighting, and the reality that people do not always look the same from one photo to the next.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-finding-clarity-in-data">🧩 Finding Clarity in Data</h3>

<p>There were days when nothing seemed to work. A small bug could turn a model’s accuracy upside down, and I learned to be patient with both the process and myself. I began to appreciate that data science is not about building perfect models. It is about asking the right questions, and then asking them again when the answers do not make sense.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/career-datascientist-graphs.jpg" alt="Working on a computer screen with graphs" class="img-fluid rounded shadow" /></p>

<p>Gradually, our results improved. The model reached an accuracy level that satisfied the team, and it was rewarding to see the outcome integrated into Telkom’s internal systems. But what I remember most is not the accuracy score. It was the long discussions with colleagues, the excitement when a new idea clicked, and the quiet satisfaction of solving something together.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-team-and-collaboration">👥 Team and Collaboration</h3>

<p>The team at Telkom Indonesia was diverse and full of energy. Some specialized in computer vision, others in data engineering, and a few, like me, sat somewhere in between. We learned from one another constantly. Someone was always willing to explain a complex algorithm or debug a stubborn error at the end of the day. The collaboration taught me that progress is rarely made alone. It is the sum of shared curiosity and persistence.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/career-datascientist-team.jpg" alt="Team brainstorming at whiteboard" class="img-fluid rounded shadow" /></p>

<p>Outside of work, we shared meals, talked about trends in artificial intelligence, and sometimes debated which machine learning framework was better. Those small interactions made the workplace feel like a community rather than a cubicle maze.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-lessons-beyond-code">🔍 Lessons Beyond Code</h3>

<p>That experience shaped the way I approach problems today. It reminded me that technical skill means little without communication, patience, and empathy for the people using the systems we build. A model can predict, but only humans can understand the story behind the data.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/career-datascientist-coffee.jpg" alt="Laptop with code and notebook beside coffee cup" class="img-fluid rounded shadow" /></p>

<p>Being part of Telkom Indonesia’s data science team was not just about algorithms or metrics. It was about learning how to work with people, how to listen, and how to stay curious no matter how complex the challenge became.</p>

In November 2021, I received the Best Research Paper Award at the International Conference on Computer Science and Computational Intelligence (ICCSCI).  
The study was titled <em>“Image Pre-Processing Effect on OCR's Performance for Image Conversion to Braille Unicode”</em> and examined how different pre-processing methods influence the accuracy of Optical Character Recognition in translating printed text into Braille Unicode.  
The paper was presented orally and later published in <em>Procedia Computer Science</em> (Elsevier) in 2023 after a delay caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
</section>

<h3 id="-the-research">🧠 The Research</h3>

<p>The project explored how image pre-processing steps such as grayscale conversion, noise reduction, and thresholding affect the accuracy of Optical Character Recognition.<br />
The goal was to improve text-to-Braille conversion for visually impaired readers by identifying which combination of pre-processing techniques yields the highest recognition accuracy.</p>

<p>The experiment compared multiple pre-processing pipelines on a dataset of scanned text images.<br />
Findings showed that specific combinations of filtering and thresholding significantly increased OCR precision and improved the reliability of Braille Unicode generation.</p>

<p>This research deepened my understanding of how small computational choices can make a real difference in accessibility technology.<br />
It also reminded me that meaningful innovation often comes from improving the details that help others read, learn, and communicate.</p>

Returning to <strong>Citra Kasih Grade School</strong> felt like walking through a memory. The same hallways, the same smell of paper and sunlight through the windows greeted me. This time I was not the student rushing to borrow books. I was the librarian who kept them organized and waiting for curious hands.
</section>

<hr />

<h3 id="-back-to-familiar-halls">🏫 Back to Familiar Halls</h3>

<p>The first day felt surreal. I recognized almost everything from the wooden counters to the reading corner where my friends and I used to sit after exams. The shelves seemed smaller, but the memories were bigger. I stood in the same spot where I once queued to borrow novels and realized how comforting it was to return, now standing on the other side of the counter.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/career-librarian-shelves.jpg" alt="Library shelves and morning sunlight" class="img-fluid rounded shadow" /></p>

<p>The first week was noisy and full of energy. The students were cheerful and difficult to manage at times, but I began to see their excitement for what it was: curiosity. Every “please be quiet” came with a smile, because deep down I was watching a reflection of my younger self.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-finding-my-rhythm">📚 Finding My Rhythm</h3>

<p>After a few days I started to find a rhythm. Some students began greeting me in the hallway. A few stopped by just to talk, even when they had nothing to return. One boy, who never seemed to sit still, started borrowing a new storybook every week. When he told me he had finished one completely, his smile was enough to make the chaos worth it.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/career-librarian-student.jpg" alt="Student reading quietly at a desk" class="img-fluid rounded shadow" /></p>

<p>I realized that managing a library was not only about maintaining order. It was also about building small connections, encouraging curiosity, and making the library a place where stories felt alive.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="‍-a-familiar-face">🧑‍🏫 A Familiar Face</h3>

<p>One afternoon I met my old Bahasa Indonesia teacher, <strong>Ms. Rina</strong>. She looked just as kind as I remembered. She smiled and said, “So you have gone from borrowing books to managing them now?” We both laughed. For a brief moment time seemed to stop. I felt proud, grateful, and a little nostalgic.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/career-librarian-teacher.jpg" alt="Teacher and librarian smiling near bookshelves" class="img-fluid rounded shadow" /></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-quiet-mornings-and-lively-afternoons">🌅 Quiet Mornings and Lively Afternoons</h3>

<p>My favorite time of day was the morning before classes started. I would open the windows and let the warm air drift through the room. The sunlight touched the shelves and made the dust in the air look like tiny sparks of gold. It was peaceful and calm, the kind of silence that feels alive.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/career-librarian-morning.jpg" alt="Empty library in morning sunlight" class="img-fluid rounded shadow" /></p>

<p>Then the students arrived. The calm turned into laughter, chatter, and movement. The quiet disappeared, but the joy remained. The library was never meant to stay silent; it was meant to breathe.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-what-i-learned">💭 What I Learned</h3>

<p>Working there taught me more than how to organize books. It taught me patience and understanding. True patience is not about waiting quietly but about staying kind when things are unpredictable. Empathy is not a weakness but a quiet strength that keeps everything together.</p>

<p>That short time reminded me that growth often happens in small moments. Sometimes it sounds like pages turning, laughter echoing, and stories being discovered again and again.</p>
