<section class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">
In November 2021, I received the Best Research Paper Award at the International Conference on Computer Science and Computational Intelligence (ICCSCI).  
The study was titled <em>“Image Pre-Processing Effect on OCR's Performance for Image Conversion to Braille Unicode”</em> and examined how different pre-processing methods influence the accuracy of Optical Character Recognition in translating printed text into Braille Unicode.  
The paper was presented orally and later published in <em>Procedia Computer Science</em> (Elsevier) in 2023 after a delay caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

### 🧠 The Research

The project explored how image pre-processing steps such as grayscale conversion, noise reduction, and thresholding affect the accuracy of Optical Character Recognition.  
The goal was to improve text-to-Braille conversion for visually impaired readers by identifying which combination of pre-processing techniques yields the highest recognition accuracy.

The experiment compared multiple pre-processing pipelines on a dataset of scanned text images.  
Findings showed that specific combinations of filtering and thresholding significantly increased OCR precision and improved the reliability of Braille Unicode generation.

This research deepened my understanding of how small computational choices can make a real difference in accessibility technology.  
It also reminded me that meaningful innovation often comes from improving the details that help others read, learn, and communicate.

### 📄 Certificate

I received the Oral Presentation Certificate for this work since the physical award ceremony was canceled during the pandemic.  
It remains one of the most meaningful recognitions in my academic journey.

### 💭 Reflection

This experience taught me that research is most valuable when it has purpose beyond theory.  
Working on assistive technology showed me how computation can empower inclusion and accessibility.  
It shaped my perspective on data science and engineering as tools not only for progress but also for empathy.
