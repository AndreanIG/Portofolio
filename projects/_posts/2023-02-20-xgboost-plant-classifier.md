We built a computer-vision pipeline to detect grape leaf diseases (**black rot**, **black measles**, **leaf blight**) from images.  
The model uses **VGG-16** for deep feature extraction and **XGBoost** as the final classifier, outperforming pure CNN baselines (VGG-16 and ResNet50) on our modified dataset.  
A lightweight **Flask** web app demonstrates end-to-end prediction.

### 🍇 Problem & Dataset
- **Task:** Image → {Healthy, Black Rot, Black Measles, Leaf Blight}.  
- **Source:** Derived from public plant-disease datasets (PlantVillage lineage); filtered to grape classes, with train/val/test split.  
- **Preprocessing:** Resize to 256×256; use framework `preprocess_input` to match backbone expectations (channel order, zero-centering).

### ⚙️ Approach
- **Backbones:** VGG-16 and ResNet50 as feature extractors (frozen base, custom head).  
- **Our best model:** VGG-16 (as feature extractor) → **Flatten** → **Dense** layers → **penultimate feature vector** → **XGBoost** (classifier).  
- **Why XGBoost on deep features?** Tree ensembles can separate non-linear boundaries efficiently with strong regularization, often improving small/medium data generalisation compared to a fully-connected softmax head alone.  
- **Serving:** Minimal **Flask** app to upload an image and return the predicted class.

### 🧩 Implementation Notes
- **Image size:** 256×256 input to backbones.  
- **Heads:** Flatten → Dense (×2) for CNN-only variants; for the hybrid, export features then fit XGBoost.  
- **Regularisation:** L2 regularisation for the XGBoost setup performed best in our tests.  
- **Training tips:** Monitor class balance; consider light augmentation (color/flip) to avoid overfitting.

---

### 💭 What I Learned
- **Hybrid models** (deep features + tree ensembles) can outperform pure CNN heads on modest datasets.  
- **Backbone choice matters,** but the classifier head and regularisation design strongly influence final performance.  
- Simple **Flask** deployment is an effective way to communicate AI results to non-technical audiences.

### 🧰 Tech Stack
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (VGG-16, ResNet50), **XGBoost**, **Flask**, **NumPy/Pandas**, **Matplotlib**.
