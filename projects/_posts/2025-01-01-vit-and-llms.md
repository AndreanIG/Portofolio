<section class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">
This project was one of the hardest and most technically demanding research works I have ever completed.  
The paper, <strong>CSER: Context-Sensitive Emotion Recognition Framework using Visual and Textual Features</strong>, introduces a multimodal system that integrates <strong>Vision Transformers (ViT)</strong> and <strong>Vision-Language Models (VLMs)</strong> — specifically LLaVA and BLIP — to improve emotion recognition in complex, real-world settings.  
It was written in collaboration with <strong>Dr. Thuseethan Selvarajah</strong>, <strong>Prof. Sutharshan Rajasegarar</strong>, and <strong>Prof. John Yearwood</strong> from Deakin University, and submitted to <em>IEEE Transactions on Multimedia</em>.

### 💡 Motivation

Most emotion recognition models focus on a single modality such as facial expressions or voice.  
In contrast, human emotion is shaped by context — the surrounding scene, body posture, and situation.  
The goal of CSER was to make emotion recognition <strong>context-aware</strong>, bridging the gap between how AI systems interpret emotions and how humans perceive them.

### ⚙️ Technical Summary

CSER combines three ViT-based visual learners for the <strong>face</strong>, <strong>body</strong>, and <strong>scene</strong> with textual embeddings generated by <strong>LLaVA</strong> and <strong>BLIP</strong>.  
All modalities are projected into a shared latent space and fused using <strong>multi-head</strong> and <strong>self-attention</strong> mechanisms.  

**Results:**  
- Achieved <strong>mAP = 40.49%</strong> on EMOTIC  
- Achieved <strong>mAP = 54.28%</strong> on HECO  
- Outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods on both datasets  
- Showed major gains in subtle emotions such as <em>sadness</em>, <em>fear</em>, and <em>embarrassment</em>

### 🧠 The Hard Part

This project required months of experimentation, dataset preparation, and repeated failures.  

**Dataset scarcity:**  
Finding <strong>group or context-sensitive emotion datasets</strong> was nearly impossible. EMOTIC and HECO were the only usable ones, but both had fragmented labels and inconsistent annotations that needed manual remapping.

**Data quality issues:**  
Many images contained occluded faces, low light, or incomplete subjects.  
To maintain uniform input shapes, I had to implement fallback logic that replaced missing faces with zero matrices — a tedious but necessary step to keep the training pipeline stable.

**Hardware constraints:**  
All experiments initially ran on a <strong>GTX 1660 Ti</strong>, forcing constant trade-offs between batch size, learning rate, and runtime stability.  
Training large vision-language models pushed the limits of available memory, often causing crashes mid-run.  
To overcome this, I used <strong>external GPU resources provided by Deakin University’s research infrastructure and Hugging Face’s compute credits</strong>.  
Setting up the remote GPU environments took significant effort — configuring CUDA, aligning PyTorch versions, and establishing secure connections — but it was essential to complete the experiments at full scale.

**VLM integration:**  
LLaVA and BLIP produced embeddings with incompatible dimensions and token structures.  
Aligning and projecting them into a shared feature space was one of the most complex implementation challenges.

**Paper formatting:**  
Preparing the IEEE manuscript involved condensing large figures, tuning Grad-CAM++ visualizations, and formatting 17 pages of results under strict LaTeX templates.  

Every part — from data cleaning to writing — tested both patience and problem-solving endurance.

### 💭 Reflection

Despite the obstacles, completing CSER taught me what true research persistence feels like.  
It was a lesson in problem-solving under constraint — working with incomplete datasets, limited hardware, and long iteration cycles — yet still producing a model that achieved measurable progress.  

Being the youngest member in the author list, I handled most of the experimental setup, ablation design, and manuscript drafting.  
This experience taught me to think beyond implementation — to question design decisions, justify model behavior, and communicate results in a research-standard way.

It reminded me that scientific progress is not just about accuracy; it’s about the discipline to keep iterating when nothing seems to work.
