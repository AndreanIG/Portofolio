<section class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">
From February to June 2022, I joined the <strong>Kaunas University of Technology (KTU)</strong> in Lithuania as an exchange student under the Faculty of Informatics.  
It was one of the most enriching experiences of my academic journey, combining creativity, technical challenges, and cultural growth in equal measure.

### ðŸŽ® Game Development Project: Temple Runner

In the <em>Fundamentals of Computer Game Development</em> module, I created a 3D endless runner game inspired by Temple Run using <strong>Unity</strong>.  
The project focused on infinite terrain generation, obstacle placement, and a chasing AI that followed the player in real time.  
Designing this system taught me how procedural generation and pathfinding interact to create engaging gameplay loops.

The development process deepened my understanding of object-oriented design, physics handling, and performance optimization in Unity.  
It also strengthened my appreciation for how creativity and engineering come together in game design.

### ðŸŽ¬ Web and Database Project: NahFlex

In the <em>Databases</em> and <em>Interactive Web Technology</em> modules, I worked on <strong>NahFlex</strong> â€” a prototype web-based movie streaming service.  
The goal was to integrate front-end design, server logic, and relational database management into a complete product.  

NahFlex featured user authentication, film categorization, watch history tracking, and an administrative dashboard.  
The project was built to demonstrate how thoughtful database schema design supports scalable and user-friendly interfaces.  
It became one of my favorite projects, combining both creativity and structure in web development.

### ðŸ¤– Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

In the <em>Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</em> course, I explored search algorithms, neural network fundamentals, and decision-making models.  
I implemented small AI experiments in Python, including classification and pattern recognition tasks.  
The subject offered a strong conceptual foundation that later guided my approach to applied AI projects.

### ðŸ§© UI and Design Principles

The <em>User Interface Design Principles</em> module focused on usability, accessibility, and interaction flow.  
Through case studies and hands-on projects, I learned how interface decisions influence user engagement and comprehension.  
The lessons from this course helped refine my design thinking and improved how I plan user experiences for software and data systems.

### ðŸ’­ Reflection

My time at KTU was more than just an exchange; it was a test of independence and adaptability.  
I learned how to collaborate across cultures, communicate ideas in different contexts, and work through new academic challenges.  
Every project â€” from the Unity game to the database-driven website â€” reinforced that technology is a universal language for creativity and problem-solving.
