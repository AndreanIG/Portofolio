<section class="lead" style="text-align: justify;" markdown="1">
In July 2018, I volunteered as a **teaching assistant** in **Bojong Koneng Village**, a small rural area in Bogor, Indonesia.  
It was a short but deeply meaningful experience that opened my eyes to the realities of education and community life beyond the city.  
For several weeks, I worked with **Grade 6 students** to help them prepare for Indonesia‚Äôs national exam while also supporting physical education and daily classroom routines.

### üìñ Teaching and Learning

The students I worked with came from humble backgrounds, yet their enthusiasm to learn was inspiring.  
Every morning began with lessons in mathematics, Indonesian, and general science, followed by review sessions for exam preparation.  
We focused on building confidence as much as mastering the material, since many of the children had limited access to learning resources.

I learned to adapt my explanations and find creative ways to make lessons engaging,  sometimes through games, stories, or group problem-solving.  
Seeing their smiles when they solved a question on their own was one of the most rewarding moments of the experience.

### üå≥ Beyond the Classroom

In the afternoons, I helped organize **calisthenics exercises** and outdoor activities.  
These sessions were more than just sports; they built teamwork, energy, and friendship among the students.

It was also a great way to connect with them beyond academics, through laughter, encouragement, and shared effort.  
Outside the classroom, I assisted local teachers and villagers with small community tasks, from organizing materials to helping with daily chores.  
It reminded me that volunteering is not only about teaching but also about being present and lending a hand where it is needed.

### üí≠ Reflection

My time in Bojong Koneng was a humble yet powerful experience.  
It showed me how education can empower and uplift communities, even when resources are limited.  
Although I was there to teach, I ended up learning just as much from the students about gratitude, perseverance, and joy in simplicity.

That experience continues to remind me why empathy matters, both in life and in technology.  
Whether I am coding, designing, or analyzing data, I try to carry the same spirit of patience, curiosity, and care that I learned in that small classroom in Bojong Koneng.
