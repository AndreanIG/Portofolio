description: "My six-month journey as a Data Scientist intern at Telkom Indonesia, where I worked on computer vision, model optimization, and learned how real AI teams operate in production environments."
---


In September 2022, I joined **Telkom Indonesia** as a **Data Scientist Intern** under the *Digital Business & Technology Division*, in a subteam called **TelkomAI**.  
It was my first real experience working in an AI lab, where cutting-edge technology met the daily challenges of sprint cycles, stand-ups, and continuous experimentation.  
Under the guidance of **Tryan Aditya Putra**, I learned not only about machine learning but also about teamwork, communication, and the patience needed to bring an algorithm from idea to reality.


---

### üß≠ Starting Out

The first few weeks were a mix of excitement and uncertainty. I was paired with another intern, and together we joined the Data Scientist team. Our early tasks were diagnostic exercises, simple algorithmic challenges to assess our thinking and approach. Soon, we began developing **a face mapping and recognition API** using DLIB and OpenCV, turning raw face data into an internal identification system capable of recognizing employees from photos.  

I remember the first time we hit a memory limit because we forgot to resize our images.  
We spent hours debugging, learning that even the most sophisticated model could fail if the basics were ignored.

---

### üß† Growing Through Challenges

Each month brought a new challenge, and every project felt like a new story to tell.  
Once the face recognition system was complete, our next task was **DIT**, a model that verified Indihome installation images using **Swin Transformers**.  
The goal was to classify not just what appeared in the photo, but whether the technician‚Äôs work met quality standards.  
It was one of those moments when I realized how human and nuanced machine learning problems could be.

By the fourth month, I was working on **fingerprint detection**, a complex project divided into several stages.  
We designed models to classify fingerprint patterns, determine swirl directions, and even locate deltas and cores using **Detectron2**.  
Each stage came with its own learning curve, pushing me to combine technical problem-solving with creativity.

Many evenings were spent studying **Vision Transformers (ViT)**, experimenting with hyperparameters, and trying to overcome the usual deep learning hurdles like overfitting.  
Sometimes, a small adjustment such as changing the learning rate or dropout value made a huge difference.  
Other times, nothing seemed to work, and the best approach was to step back, take a breath, and start fresh.

---

### üí° Lessons Beyond Code

Working at Telkom taught me that building AI systems is not only about writing clean code but also about asking good questions.  
Every sprint began with a stand-up meeting that reminded us communication was just as important as technical skill.  
When challenges appeared, I learned to take initiative, seek feedback, and collaborate instead of waiting for direction.  
Explaining models to non-technical teammates became one of the most valuable exercises, helping me realize that understanding something deeply means being able to teach it clearly.

Over time, I saw how **critical thinking**, **digital fluency**, and **creativity** are deeply connected in the real world.  
Choosing between **Swin** and **ViT** architectures or dealing with unstable gradients required both logic and imagination.

---

### üöÄ What I Took Away

My six months at TelkomAI changed how I viewed data science.
It turned theoretical knowledge into real-world experience, where algorithms became practical tools and collaboration held everything together.
I left not just with functional models but also with a better mindset for solving problems under real constraints.

The experience also helped me see how much I enjoy the balance between data, design, and people.
For me, AI became more than a technical pursuit, it became a craft that blends precision with empathy.

---

### üì∏ Team Moment
![Telkom Internship Team](/assets/img/telkom-intern.jpeg){: .lead width="480" height="270" loading="lazy"}


During our internship, a few of us from the **TelkomAI** team finally met up in **Bandung** after months of collaborating online.  
It was one of those rare moments when Slack handles turned into real faces, and code reviews turned into shared laughter over coffee.  
That meetup reminded me that behind every great AI project, there are people learning, failing, and growing together.


### üí≠ Reflection

Looking back, this internship was never just about completing perfect projects.
It was about learning how to navigate uncertainty, stay curious, and keep improving.
I discovered that mistakes are simply stepping stones, and persistence often matters more than immediate success.
The lessons I learned at Telkom, both technical and personal, continue to shape how I approach new challenges in AI, software development, and beyond.
