### üí≠ Reflection

My time at Deakin taught me to approach AI as both a science and a social responsibility.  
The program encouraged me to think critically about bias, interpretability, and fairness in data-driven systems.  
It also helped me develop confidence in presenting technical work to non-technical audiences and collaborating across disciplines.  

This degree built on my undergraduate foundation and prepared me for work at the intersection of **machine learning, research, and applied AI design**.
