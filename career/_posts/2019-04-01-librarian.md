<section class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">
Returning to <strong>Citra Kasih Grade School</strong> felt like walking through a memory. The same hallways, the same smell of paper and sunlight through the windows greeted me. This time I was not the student rushing to borrow books. I was the librarian who kept them organized and waiting for curious hands.

### 🏫 Back to Familiar Halls

The first day felt surreal. I recognized almost everything from the wooden counters to the reading corner where my friends and I used to sit after exams. The shelves seemed smaller, but the memories were bigger. I stood in the same spot where I once queued to borrow novels and realized how comforting it was to return, now standing on the other side of the counter.

The first week was noisy and full of energy. The students were cheerful and difficult to manage at times, but I began to see their excitement for what it was: curiosity. Every “please be quiet” came with a smile, because deep down I was watching a reflection of my younger self.

### 📚 Finding My Rhythm

After a few days I started to find a rhythm. Some students began greeting me in the hallway. A few stopped by just to talk, even when they had nothing to return. One boy, who never seemed to sit still, started borrowing a new storybook every week. When he told me he had finished one completely, his smile was enough to make the chaos worth it.

I realized that managing a library was not only about maintaining order. It was also about building small connections, encouraging curiosity, and making the library a place where stories felt alive.

### 🧑‍🏫 A Familiar Face

One afternoon I met my old Bahasa Indonesia teacher, <strong>Ms. Rina</strong>. She looked just as kind as I remembered. She smiled and said, “So you have gone from borrowing books to managing them now?” We both laughed. For a brief moment time seemed to stop. I felt proud, grateful, and a little nostalgic.

### 🌅 Quiet Mornings and Lively Afternoons

My favorite time of day was the morning before classes started. I would open the windows and let the warm air drift through the room. The sunlight touched the shelves and made the dust in the air look like tiny sparks of gold. It was peaceful and calm, the kind of silence that feels alive.

Then the students arrived. The calm turned into laughter, chatter, and movement. The quiet disappeared, but the joy remained. The library was never meant to stay silent; it was meant to breathe.

### 💭 What I Learned

Working there taught me more than how to organize books. It taught me patience and understanding. True patience is not about waiting quietly but about staying kind when things are unpredictable. Empathy is not a weakness but a quiet strength that keeps everything together.

That short time reminded me that growth often happens in small moments. Sometimes it sounds like pages turning, laughter echoing, and stories being discovered again and again.
