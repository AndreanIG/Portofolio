<section class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">
Working as a <strong>Data Scientist at Telkom Indonesia</strong> was both exciting and humbling. It was my first time applying machine learning in a large company environment, surrounded by people whose curiosity matched their technical skill. Every day brought a mix of learning, experimentation, and teamwork that reminded me why I fell in love with data in the first place.

### üß† First Impressions

The first few weeks were filled with exploration. I spent hours reading documentation, studying internal systems, and understanding how different teams approached data problems. I had worked with models before, but this was different. Here, my code was part of something larger ‚Äî a system that affected real employees, real processes, and real decisions.

My first major project focused on facial recognition for employee management. The idea was simple: create a system that could identify staff members efficiently, helping automate attendance and improve security. Simple ideas, however, rarely stay simple. There were countless details to consider ‚Äî image quality, lighting, and the reality that people do not always look the same from one photo to the next.

### üß© Finding Clarity in Data

There were days when nothing seemed to work. A small bug could turn a model‚Äôs accuracy upside down, and I learned to be patient with both the process and myself. I began to appreciate that data science is not about building perfect models. It is about asking the right questions, and then asking them again when the answers do not make sense.

Gradually, our results improved. The model reached an accuracy level that satisfied the team, and it was rewarding to see the outcome integrated into Telkom‚Äôs internal systems. But what I remember most is not the accuracy score. It was the long discussions with colleagues, the excitement when a new idea clicked, and the quiet satisfaction of solving something together.

### üë• Team and Collaboration

The team at Telkom Indonesia was diverse and full of energy. Some specialized in computer vision, others in data engineering, and a few, like me, sat somewhere in between. We learned from one another constantly. Someone was always willing to explain a complex algorithm or debug a stubborn error at the end of the day. The collaboration taught me that progress is rarely made alone. It is the sum of shared curiosity and persistence.

Outside of work, we shared meals, talked about trends in artificial intelligence, and sometimes debated which machine learning framework was better. Those small interactions made the workplace feel like a community rather than a cubicle maze.

### üîç Lessons Beyond Code

That experience shaped the way I approach problems today. It reminded me that technical skill means little without communication, patience, and empathy for the people using the systems we build. A model can predict, but only humans can understand the story behind the data.

Being part of Telkom Indonesia‚Äôs data science team was not just about algorithms or metrics. It was about learning how to work with people, how to listen, and how to stay curious no matter how complex the challenge became.
