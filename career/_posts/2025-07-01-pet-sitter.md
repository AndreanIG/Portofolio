<section class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">
I joined <strong>Camp Paws</strong> in Melbourne because I have always loved animals. I missed my pets back home and wanted to do something that let me reconnect with that sense of care and companionship. Working as a pet sitter was also a way for me to improve my communication skills and learn to handle responsibility in unfamiliar environments.

### üêæ Starting Out

Camp Paws did not have a physical office. Everything was managed through <strong>WhatsApp</strong> and a specialized application. I applied for several assignments when I first joined, but many were rejected. Some clients preferred sitters with more experience or longer availability. At first, it was disappointing, but I learned to approach each rejection as a chance to improve. I refined how I introduced myself, how I communicated reliability, and how I described my previous experience with animals.

Eventually, I began to receive more trust from clients. The first few visits were careful and quiet. I entered other people‚Äôs homes, followed instructions precisely, and took time to understand each dog‚Äôs habits. I learned to be patient and consistent, especially with animals that took time to warm up to new people.

### üê∂ The Dogs I Remember Most

Among the many dogs I cared for, three stand out in my memory: <strong>Ivy</strong>, <strong>Ziggy</strong>, and <strong>Kreuzer</strong>.  
Ivy was gentle and alert, always watching before coming close. Ziggy liked to follow routines and noticed every small change. Kreuzer was strong and playful, but needed calm handling when walking outdoors. They each taught me something different about care and observation.

Through them, I learned that trust is not something that can be rushed. It is built through quiet repetition, small gestures, and consistent presence. These lessons stayed with me long after each visit ended.

### ‚ú® Lessons Learned

Working as a pet sitter was not only about caring for animals. It was about developing patience and empathy in practical ways. I learned that communication is more than what is spoken. Dogs respond to tone, energy, and rhythm. The way I moved or reacted could change how they behaved. This awareness also improved how I interacted with clients, helping me communicate clearly and respectfully.

The rejections I faced at the beginning reminded me to be humble and persistent. Over time, I learned that responsibility grows not just from experience but from reliability and genuine care.

### üí≠ Reflection

This experience reminded me of my own pets, the routines I used to have with them, and how much those small moments meant to me. Being around Ivy, Ziggy, and Kreuzer gave me a sense of home in a different city. It also helped me appreciate the simple value of care such as showing up on time, keeping promises, and being patient when things do not go as planned.

Every visit taught me something about trust and consistency, both in animals and in people. It was quiet work, but it left a lasting impression on how I understand empathy and communication.
