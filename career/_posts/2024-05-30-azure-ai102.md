<section class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">
In May 2024, I earned the Microsoft Certified Azure AI Engineer Associate credential.  
The program deepened my understanding of how to design, implement, and manage AI applications that run in production environments on Azure.  
It connected theoretical knowledge of machine learning with real implementation practices using cloud infrastructure.

### ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

The course introduced me to Azure Cognitive Services, the Machine Learning Studio, and the orchestration of data pipelines for scalable AI models.  
Through practical projects, I learned how to integrate services for vision, speech, and language understanding into complete end-to-end solutions.  
It also taught me how to optimize performance, secure data, and ensure ethical and responsible use of AI.

More than the technical material, this certification improved how I think about deploying AI at scale.  
I began to see the importance of reliability, monitoring, and transparency when designing systems that directly impact users and organizations.
