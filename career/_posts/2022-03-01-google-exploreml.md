<section class="lead" style="text-align: justify;" markdown="1">
In March 2022, I joined the **Google Explore ML** program ‚Äî a global learning initiative designed to introduce students to the world of artificial intelligence.  
It was my first real encounter with the theory and practice behind machine learning, and it became one of the sparks that shaped my future path in AI.

### üå± Learning the Fundamentals

The Explore ML program covered the **core concepts of machine learning**, including supervised and unsupervised learning, model training, and data preprocessing.  
We learned how algorithms identify patterns, make predictions, and improve over time.  
Although the examples were simple, they opened my eyes to how small models could form the foundation of large-scale systems that power real-world applications.

I still remember my excitement when I trained my first small classification model ‚Äî it wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it worked.  
That simple success made me realize how much I enjoyed experimenting with data and discovering patterns hidden inside it.

### ü§ù Collaboration and Mentorship

The sessions were guided by mentors from the **Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC)** community.  
Working alongside peers from diverse backgrounds made the learning process even more engaging.  
Everyone was encouraged to share ideas, ask questions, and explore how machine learning could solve problems in areas like healthcare, education, and sustainability.  

It wasn‚Äôt just about technical skills; it was about learning how to think like an AI practitioner ‚Äî curious, data-driven, and responsible.

### üí≠ Reflection

Looking back, the Explore ML program gave me more than just an introduction to AI.  
It taught me that curiosity is the key ingredient to learning anything new.  
This experience gave me the foundation I needed to confidently pursue more advanced AI certifications and research later on ‚Äî including my journey with Azure AI and my internship at Telkom Indonesia.
