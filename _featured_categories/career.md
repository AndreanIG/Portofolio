Welcome to my <strong>Career Journey</strong>! 
Here‚Äôs where you can scroll through the story of how I went from  
a <em>school librarian</em> to a <em>data scientist</em> and even as a <em>pet sitter</em> in between üêæ.  
Each chapter has its own lessons, challenges, and a little fun along the way.
